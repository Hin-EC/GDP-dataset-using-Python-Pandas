# GDP-dataset-using-Python-Pandas

This project demonstrates how to **explore and manipulate a GDP dataset** using **Python and Pandas**. The goal is to perform various **data cleaning and transformation operations**, including removing duplicates, filtering data based on conditions, and replacing zeros with the mean (excluding zeros).

The project consists of a **Jupyter Notebook** that provides step-by-step explanations and code examples.

## Project Overview

In this project, I worked on the following **data operations** using Pandas:

- **Exploring the dataset** (summary statistics & dataset information)
- **Removing duplicate rows** to ensure data consistency
- **Filtering data** based on given conditions
- **Replacing zero values** with the mean (excluding zeros) for better analysis

## Steps Covered

### 1. **Exploring the Dataset**
- Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Use `.info()` and `.head()` to understand the dataset structure.

### 2. **Removing Duplicate Rows**
- Identify and remove duplicate rows using `drop_duplicates()` to ensure data integrity.

### 3. **Filtering Data**
- Extract subsets of data based on specific conditions.

### 4. **Replacing Zero with Mean (Excluding Zeros)**
- Compute the mean of a column while excluding zeros.
- Replace zero values with this computed mean using `replace()`.
